       "Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment on maximum voluntary force (MVF) production. Methods: Ten healthy, young subjects (5 males and 5 females) participated in the study. MVF was recorded after a fifteen minute session of TENS stimulation under two conditions: low frequency (4 Hz) at maximum tolerable level and high frequency (110 Hz) at maximum tolerable level. TENS was provided simultaneously via self-adhesive electrodes placed on the finger pads of the index, middle, ring and little fingers. MVF was also recorded in a baseline condition with no TENS treatment. Data were collected in three different sessions on three consecutive days at the sametime of the day. Results: Results from the study show that on an average, MVF increasesby 25% for the index, middle and little fingers for TENS treatment with 4 Hz frequency as compared to the baseline condition. However, the 110 Hz condition did not result in a significantly different MVF than the baseline condition during individual finger pressing tasks. In addition, while producing MVF with all the four finger stogether, MVF was 30% higher for the 4 Hz conditionin comparison to the baseline condition, and 15% higher for the 110 Hz condition in comparison to the baseline condition respectively. Conclusion: The results suggest that stimulation ofafferent fibers onthe glabrous skinwith TENS could have a net facilitatory effect on the maximum motoroutput.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     2\n",
       "Objective: The incidence rate of elbow ulnar collateral ligament injuries is dependent on the throwing speed or pitching type, especially in adolescent baseball players. However, mixed results have been reported due to a lack of controlled biomechanical analysis. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the biomechanical analysis of the elbow in relation to throwing speed and pitching type.\\nMethod: Four overhead type high-school baseball players were recruited for this study. The participants were asked to throw balls with different types of pitch and speed. While the throwing speeds were measured, each pitching moment of the elbow was recorded. Descriptive statistics, frequency analysis, mean comparison analysis, and Pearson's correlation analysis were performed in order to examine differences in peak varus and valgus moment during pitching motion in the elbow in all throwing speed and pitching types.\\nResults: There was no significant difference in physical characteristics, throwing speed, and momentum variability among all players. The mean varus moments were 44.38±1.55 Nm, 48.83±1.66 Nm, and 48.94±0.95 Nm, and the moment gaps between varus and valgus were 7.36±3.25 Nm, 7.44±2.02 Nm, and 7.36±2.62 Nm in fastball, curveball, and slider ball, respectively. The varus moment was higher in the curved and slider balls than in the fastballs, and there was no significant differences between the varus moments regarding the pitching type. However, the increase in valgus moment and decrease in moment gap according to throwing speed was significantly increased in the slider ball (r=0.718 and -0.591, respectively).\\nConclusion: The possibility of elbow injury caused by the valgus moment or moment gap increases more rapidly in slider balls as the speed increases. Based on our results, appropriate pitching guidelines should be suggested to prevent ulnar ligament injuries, especially in adolescent baseball players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2\n",
       "Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate plantar foot pressure and static balance according to the type of insole in the elderly.\\nMethods: Thirteen elderly (mean age: 67.08±2.25 years, mean height: 159.63±9.64 cm, mean body weight: 61.48±9.06 kg) who had no previous injury experience in the lower limbs and a normal gait pattern participated in this study. Three models of insoles of the normal, 3D, and triangle types were selected for the test. The Pedar-X system and Pedar-X insoles, 3.3 km/h of walking speed, and a compilation of 20 steps walking stages were used to analyze foot-pressure distribution. Static balance test was conducted using Gaitview AFA-50, and balance (opening eyes, closing eyes) was inspected for 20 s. One-way ANOVA was conducted to test the significance of the results with the three insoles. P-value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.\\nResults: The mean foot pressure under the forefoot regions was the lowest with the 3D insole during treadmill walking (p<.05). The mean value under the midfoot was the highest with the 3D insole (left: p<.05, right: p<.01). The mean value under the rearfoot was the lowest with the 3D insole (p<.001). The maximum foot pressure value under the foot regions was the lowest on both sides of the forefoot with the 3D insole. A statistically significant difference was seen only in the left foot (p<.01). The maximum value under the midfoot was the highest with the 3D insole (p<.001). No statistically significant difference was detected on the values under the rearfoot. In the case of vertical ground reaction force (GRF), statistically significant difference was seen only in the left side rearfoot (p<.01). However, static balance values (ENV, REC, RMS, Total Length, Sway velocity, and Length/ENV) did not show significant differences by the type of insole.\\nConclusion: These results show that functional insoles can decrease plantar pressure and GRF under the forefoot and rearfoot. Moreover, functional insoles can dislodge the overload of the rearfoot and forefoot to the midfoot. However, functional insoles do not affect the static balance in the elderly.                                                                                    1\n",
       "Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify kinematic variables that govern successful performance and judges' scores and to establish correlative relationships among those of Yurchenko layout with a full twist in female vaults.\\nMethod: Four video cameras with sampling rate of 60 Hz collected 32 motion data of Yurchenko vaults from twenty-two female participants (age: 18.6 ± 3.6 years, height: 153.0 ± 6.5 cm, mass: 44.7 ± 7.3 kg) during national competition. Posting processing and calculations of kinematic variables were performed in Kwon 3D XP and Matlab® programs. Correlation and regression analyses were applied to find the relationships between the obtained scores and kinematic variables. Deterministic model (Hay & Reid, 1988) was used to investigate the strength of correlative relationships among kinematic variables.\\nResults: The obtained scores from the judges' decision were mainly affected by post-flight peak height, horse contact time, knee angle at landing, and horse takeoff angle. Strong blocking during horse contact was required to get successful performance and obtain high scores. Modified deterministic model showed that round-off entrance and takeoff angles and resultant velocity of the center of mass (CM) during the roundoff phase were the starting variables affecting performance in the following kinematics. Knee angle at landing, a highly influential variable on the obtained point, was only determined by judges' decision without significant correlative relationship with previous kinematic variables.\\nConclusion: The obtained scores highly depended on kinematic variables of post-flight and horse contact phases that were affected by those from the previous phases including round-off postures and resultant velocity of the body center of mass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

       "Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the physical characteristics (bone mineral density, joint muscle strength) and running biomechanics between older adults and young adult runners to understand the changes of running strategy by aging. Method: Bone mineral density (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, USA) of lower lower extremity and muscle strength (Cybex Humac Norm [DEXA], CSMI, USA) were measured to identify the physical characteristics of 10 elderly (age: $67.70{\\pm}3.30yrs$, height: $1.68{\\pm}0.04m$, mass: $67.70{\\pm}3.80kg$) and 10 young adults (age: $21.20{\\pm}0.42yrs$, height: $1.73{\\pm}0.06m$, mass: $72.11{\\pm}4.15kg$). Running data was collected by using an instrumented treadmill (Bertec, USA) and 7 infrared cameras (Oqus 300, Qualisys, Sweden). Two-way repeated ANOVA analysis was used to analyze results at a significant level of .05 with Bonferroni post hoc analysis. Results: Compared to the young adult group, the elderly group showed statistically significant difference in physical characteristics and in running characteristics. Elderly runners showed lower BMD and muscle strength compared with young runners (p<.05). In the running parameters, elderly runners tend to show shorter contact time and stride length compared with young runners (p<.05). In the joint angles, elderly runners showed smaller range of ankle motion compared with young runners (p<.05). Finally, elderly runners showed lower level of joint moment, joint power, and GRF compared with young runners in each running speed (p<.05). Conclusion: The running behavior of the elderly performed periodic running was similar to many variables of young adults. However, there were noticeable differences found in the ankle joints and most kinetic variables compared with young adult runners. This discrepancy may propose that elderly runners should consider appropriate running distance and intensity in the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "Objective: This study examined the effects of stimulating fingertip temperature on the patterns of force sharing and stability properties during multi-finger force production tasks. Method: 9 adult subjects (male: 3, female: 6, age: $26.11{\\pm}4.01yrs$, height: $169.22{\\pm}5.97cm$, weight: $61.44{\\pm}11.27kg$) participated in this study. The experiment consisted of three blocks: 1) maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) task, 2) single-finger ramp task to quantify enslaving (i.e., unintended force production by non-task fingers), and 3) 12 trials of multi-finger steady-state force production task at 20% MVC. There were three temperature conditions including body-temperature (i.e., control condition), $40^{\\circ}C$, and $43^{\\circ}C$, and the stimulation was given to the index finger only for all experimental conditions. Results: There were no significant differences in the MVC forces, enslaving, and the accuracy of performance during the steady-state task between the conditions. However, the share of stimulated index finger force increased with the index fingertip temperature, while the share of middle finger force decreased. Also, the coefficient of variation of both index and middle finger forces over repetitive trials increased with the index fingertip temperature. Under the framework of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis used to quantify indices of multi-finger synergies (i.e., stability property) stabilizing total force during the steady-state task, the two variance components within the UCM analysis increased together with the fingertip temperature, while no changes in the synergy indices between the conditions. Conclusion: The current results showed that fingertip temperature stimulation only to index finger does not affect to muscle force production capability of multi-finger, independence of individual fingers, and force production accuracy by the involvement of all four fingers. The effect of fingertip temperature on the sharing pattern and force variation may be due to diffuse reflex effects of the induced afferent activity on alpha-motoneuronal pools. However, the unchanged stability properties may be the reflection of the active error compensation strategies by non-stimulated finger actions.      1\n",
       "Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of midsole hardness of running shoe on muscle fatigue and impact force during distance running. Method: Ten healthy college recreational runners who were performing distance running at least three times a week participated in this experiment. They were asked to run for 15 minutes in the treadmill at 10 km/h with running shoes having three different types of midsole hardness (Soft, Medium, Hard). EMG signal and insole pressure were collected during the first and last one minute for each running trials. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. Results: Midsole hardness did not affect the consistency of stride length. For the median frequency of the EMG signal, only VL was affected by midsole hardness; that of medium was greater than other midsoles (p<.05). The loading rate of impact forces increased by midsole hardness (p<.01). Conclusion: Although soft midsole could attenuate impact forces at heel contact, it might have a negative effect on the fatigue of muscle which could decelerate the body after heel contact. Therefore, it is necessary to select the optimum hardness of midsole carefully for both reduction impact forces and muscle fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "Objective: It is to find factors related to stability through analysis of plantar pressure factors according to the level of instability when performing Snatch.\\nMethod: Foot pressure analysis was performed while 10 weightlifters performed 80% of the highest level of Snatch, and motion was classified and analyzed in 3 grades according to the level of instability.\\nResults: First, in Bad Motion, the movement distance of the pressure center in the direction of ML and AP was larger significantly in Phase 2. Second, in Phase 2, the number of zero-crossing in the AP direction was larger statistically significantly in Good Motion. Third, in the bad motion in Phase 3, the number of zero-crossing in the ML direction showed a significantly larger value. Fourth, in Phase 4, it was found that the more stable the lock out motion, the greater the activity of foot controlling in the left and right directions. Fifth, Phase 3, the greater the Maximum/Mean foot pressure value, the more stable the pulling action. Sixth, in Phase 2, the foot pressure was concentrated with a wide distribution in the midfoot and rearfoot. Seventh, the triggering number of the forefoot region was small in the last pull phase. Eighth, the number of triggers in the toe area was significantly higher during Good Motion in Phase 4.\\nConclusion: Summarizing the factors of instability in Snatch, there was no significant difference in Phase 1 for each condition. In order to enhance the stability in Phase 2, the sensory control ability in the AP direction is required, and focusing the foot pressing motion with a wide distribution in the middle and rear parts increases the instability. In Phase 3, it was found that the more unstable, the more sensory control activity was performed in the ML direction, the stronger the forefoot pressing action should be performed for a stable Snatch. In Phase 4, It is important that the feet sensory control activity in ML directions and the control ability of the toes in order to have stable Lock out motion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
       "이 연구의 목적은 각 분절의 마커세트와 무릎관절 중심 정의가 3차원 무릎 관절각을 산출하는데 얼마나 민감하게 영향을 미치는지를 연구하였다. 자료수집은 1명을 실험대상자로 하여 두 가지 형태의 각기 다른 분절의 정의와 무릎관절의 중심을 나타내는 반사마커들을 동시에 오른쪽 하지에 부착시켜 실험을 실시하였다. 실험대상자의 달리기동작 중 좌측으로 45도 방향전환동작의 지지기를 분석하였다. 이를 위해서 8대의 고속카메라들을 이용하였고 달리기속도는 4m/$sec{\\pm}(10%)$로 통제하였다. 하지분절의 발분절에는 하나의 마커세트를, 정강이와 대퇴분절에는 두 가지의 다른 마커세트들을 부착시켰다. 발분절에는 3개의 마커를 신발의 뒷부분에 부착하였고 정강이분절을 정의하기 위하여 첫 번째 마커세트는 경골을 중심으로 3개의 마커들을 두 번째 마커세트는 비골을 중심으로 3개의 마커를 부착하였다. 대퇴분절의 마커세트를 정의하기 위하여 첫 번째 마커세트에는 대퇴골을 중심으로 3개의 마커를 두 번째 마커세트에는 대퇴근육을 중심으로 3개의 마커들을 부착하였다. 무릎관절중심을 정의하는데 두 가지 다른 정의가 적용되었다. 첫 번째 무릎중심을 무릎의 내측과 외측의 마커들을 통해 두 마커의 중심을 무릎관절의 중심으로 정의하였다. 두 번째 무릎중심정의는 무릎의 외측부분과 슬개골의 중심에 부착된 마커들로부터의 교차점을 무릎관절중심으로 산출하였다. 무릎관절의 각도를 산출하기 위해서 JCS(Joint Coordinate System)의 정의가 적용되었고 연구의 결과는 다음과 같았다. 두 가지의 다른 분절마커세트 사이에서 무릎의 신전(extension)과 굴곡(flexion)은 유사한 형태를 나타냈으며 최대 무릎굴곡(peak knee flexion)각에서 $4.746^{\\circ}$의 차이를 나타냈다. 다른 분절마커세트 사이의 회전(rotation)각과 내전(adduction)/외전(abduction)에서는 서로 다른 형태를 나타내었고, 두 마커세트간 최대무릎외측회전(peak knee external rotation)각도에서는 $15.628^{\\circ}$의 차이를 나타냈다. 또한, 각 분절마커세트 내에서 두 가지의 다른 무릎관절 중심의 정의가 얼마나 무릎도 산출에 영향을 미치는지를 비교했을 때 무릎의 최대외측회전(peak external rotation)각에서 차이를 나타내었다. 첫 번째 분절마커세트의 무릎관절중심정의의 형태변화에 따라 최대외측회전각은 $0.549^{\\circ}$의 차이를 나타냈고, 두 번째 분절마커 세트에서 무릎관절중심정의의 형태변화에 따라 최대외측회전각은 $0.309^{\\circ}$의 차이를 나타냈다. 이와 같이 분절을 나타내는 마커세트와 무릎관절중심정의의 형태변화에 따라 무릎간을 계산하는데 있어서 결과가 다르게 산출되었다. 즉, 관절각의 계산이 분절에 부착되는 마커의 정의 혹은 위치에 매우 민감하게 영향을 받았다. 따라서 연구자가 여러 실험대상자들을 대상으로 실험시 마커세트 혹은 마커들을 동일한 위치에 가깝게 부착하는 것이 마커부착으로부터 발생하는 실험오차를 줄일 수 있을 것이다.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "Korean Journal of Sport Biomechanics(KJSB) is facing down by a great challenge. Following the long-term plan of the Korean Society of Sport Biomechanics, the KJSB has entered a new era in 2010 in the sense that the some papers are published in English. Immense efforts are needed to accomplish the original goal of KJSB becoming an internationally recognized journal. The 2009 Spring International Conference of the KSSB was held in this connection with the subject of the vitalization of the KJSB. A special topic were presented at the Conference and vigorous discussions followed. The Editor-in-Chief of KJSB presented strategies to improve the number of suggestion to the KJSB. The Manager of Thomson Reuter gave a presentation on how KJSB can grow into the SCI-expanded journal. This manuscript is presented on the basis of the presentations and the discussions at the meeting for the purpose of finding the way in aiming the direction of the long-term goal of the KJSB.

       "Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effect of walking on high heels on the behavior of fascicle length and activation of the lower limb muscles.\\nMethods: Twelve healthy inexperienced high heel wearers (age: 23.1 ± 2.0 yr, height: 162.4 ± 4.9 cm, weight: 54.4 ± 8.5 kg) participated in this study. They walked in high heels (7 cm) and barefoot on a treadmill at their preferred speed. During the gait analysis, the lower limb joint kinematics were obtained using a motion analysis system. In addition, the changes in fascicle length and the level of activation of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) were simultaneously monitored using a real-time ultrasound imaging technique and surface electromyography, respectively.\\nResults: The results of this study show that the MG fascicle operates at a significantly shorter length in high heel walking (37.64 ± 8.59 mm to 43.99 ± 8.66 mm) in comparison with barefoot walking (48.26 ± 9.02 mm to 53.99 ± 8.54 mm) (p < .05). In addition, the MG fascicle underwent lengthening during high heel walking with relatively low muscle activation while it remained isometric during barefoot walking with relatively high muscle activation.\\nConclusion: Wearing high heels alters the operating range of the MG fascicle length and the pattern of muscle activation, suggesting that prolonged wearing of high heels might induce structural alterations of the MG that, in turn, hinder normal functioning of the MG muscle during walking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
       "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in FT (free-torque) components between non-fatigue and fatigue conditions induced by prolonged running.\\nMethods: Fifteen healthy runners with no previous lower-extremity fractures (22.0 ± 2.1 years of age) participated in this study. Ground reaction force data were collected for the right-stance phase for 10 strides of 5 and 125-min running periods at 1,000 Hz using an instrumented force platform (instrumented dual-belt treadmills, Bertec, USA) while the subjects ran on it. The running speed was set according to the preferences of the subjects, which were determined before the experiment. FT variables were calculated from the components of the moment and force output from the force platform. A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA was used to test for significant differences between the two conditions. The alpha level for all the statistical tests was 0.05.\\nResults: The absolute FT at the peak braking force was significantly greater after 5 mins of running than after 125 mins of running—which was regarded as a fatigued state—but there were no significant differences in the absolute peak FT or impulse between the conditions.\\nConclusion: The FT variables in the fatigue condition during prolonged running hardly affect the tibial stress syndrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "Objective: This study aimed to examine the characteristics of joint kinematics and synchronicity of rowing motion between elite and non-elite rowers.\\nMethods: Two elite and two non-elite rowers performed rowing strokes (3 trials, 20 strokes in each trial) at three different stroke rates (20, 30, 40 stroke/min) on two stationary rowing ergometers. The rowing motions of the rowers were captured using a 3-dimensional motion analysis system (8-infrared camera VICON system, Oxford, UK). The range of motion (RoM) of the knee, hip, and elbow joints on the sagittal plane, the lead time (TLead) and the drive time TDrive) for each joint, and the elapsed time for the knee joint to maintain a fully extended position (TKnee) during the stroke were analyzed and compared between elite and non-elite rowers. Synchronicity of the rowing motion within and between groups was examined using coefficients of variation (CV) of the TDrive for each joint.\\nResults: Regardless of the stroke rate, the RoM of all joints were greater for the elite than for non-elite rowers, except for the RoMs of the knee joint at 30 stroke/min and the elbow joint at 40 stroke/min (p < .05). Although the TLead at all stroke rates were the same between the groups, the TDrive for each joint was shorter for the elite than for the non-elite rowers. During the drive phase, elite rowers kept the fully extended knee joint angle longer than the non-elite rowers (p < .05). The CV values of the TDrive within each group were smaller for the elite compared with non-elite rowers, except for the CV values of the hip at all stroke/min and elbow at 40 stroke/min.\\nConclusion: The elite, compared with non-elite, rowers seem to be able to perform more powerful and efficient rowing strokes with large RoM and a short TDrive with the same TLead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of using external kinesio-tape wrapping for inner arch support on the lower extremity EMG for gait in stiletto heels.\\nMethods: Subjects for this study were two female college students who had been wearing stiletto heels almost every day of the week for more than three years. The independent variable was the presence or absence of kinesio-tape wrap for inner arch support. Dependent variables were EMG readings for the four muscle groups: the medial and lateral gastrocnemius, the tibialis anterior, and the peroneus longus. EMG readings were taken using the NORAXON (USA). The Paired t-test within the subject repeated measure design for the presence and absence of inner arch support (p<0.05) was used via SPSS 18.0.\\nResults: With kinesio-tape wrap for inner arch support, there was a statistically significant decrease in the muscle force mean values for the peroneus longus and the medial and lateral gastrocnemius, in the maximum muscle forces of the peroneus longus and the lateral gastrocnemius.\\nConclusion: External kinesio-tape wrapping for inner arch support in stiletto heels could have an effect to reduce peroneus longus, and medial/lateral gastrocnemius activities that could result in decreased fatigue and discomfort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

       "Objective: This study examined the effects of stimulating fingertip temperature on the patterns of force sharing and stability properties during multi-finger force production tasks. Method: 9 adult subjects (male: 3, female: 6, age: $26.11{\\pm}4.01yrs$, height: $169.22{\\pm}5.97cm$, weight: $61.44{\\pm}11.27kg$) participated in this study. The experiment consisted of three blocks: 1) maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) task, 2) single-finger ramp task to quantify enslaving (i.e., unintended force production by non-task fingers), and 3) 12 trials of multi-finger steady-state force production task at 20% MVC. There were three temperature conditions including body-temperature (i.e., control condition), $40^{\\circ}C$, and $43^{\\circ}C$, and the stimulation was given to the index finger only for all experimental conditions. Results: There were no significant differences in the MVC forces, enslaving, and the accuracy of performance during the steady-state task between the conditions. However, the share of stimulated index finger force increased with the index fingertip temperature, while the share of middle finger force decreased. Also, the coefficient of variation of both index and middle finger forces over repetitive trials increased with the index fingertip temperature. Under the framework of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis used to quantify indices of multi-finger synergies (i.e., stability property) stabilizing total force during the steady-state task, the two variance components within the UCM analysis increased together with the fingertip temperature, while no changes in the synergy indices between the conditions. Conclusion: The current results showed that fingertip temperature stimulation only to index finger does not affect to muscle force production capability of multi-finger, independence of individual fingers, and force production accuracy by the involvement of all four fingers. The effect of fingertip temperature on the sharing pattern and force variation may be due to diffuse reflex effects of the induced afferent activity on alpha-motoneuronal pools. However, the unchanged stability properties may be the reflection of the active error compensation strategies by non-stimulated finger actions.    1\n",
       "Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of midsole hardness of running shoe on muscle fatigue and impact force during distance running. Method: Ten healthy college recreational runners who were performing distance running at least three times a week participated in this experiment. They were asked to run for 15 minutes in the treadmill at 10 km/h with running shoes having three different types of midsole hardness (Soft, Medium, Hard). EMG signal and insole pressure were collected during the first and last one minute for each running trials. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. Results: Midsole hardness did not affect the consistency of stride length. For the median frequency of the EMG signal, only VL was affected by midsole hardness; that of medium was greater than other midsoles (p<.05). The loading rate of impact forces increased by midsole hardness (p<.01). Conclusion: Although soft midsole could attenuate impact forces at heel contact, it might have a negative effect on the fatigue of muscle which could decelerate the body after heel contact. Therefore, it is necessary to select the optimum hardness of midsole carefully for both reduction impact forces and muscle fatigue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
       "Objective: It is to find factors related to stability through analysis of plantar pressure factors according to the level of instability when performing Snatch.\\nMethod: Foot pressure analysis was performed while 10 weightlifters performed 80% of the highest level of Snatch, and motion was classified and analyzed in 3 grades according to the level of instability.\\nResults: First, in Bad Motion, the movement distance of the pressure center in the direction of ML and AP was larger significantly in Phase 2. Second, in Phase 2, the number of zero-crossing in the AP direction was larger statistically significantly in Good Motion. Third, in the bad motion in Phase 3, the number of zero-crossing in the ML direction showed a significantly larger value. Fourth, in Phase 4, it was found that the more stable the lock out motion, the greater the activity of foot controlling in the left and right directions. Fifth, Phase 3, the greater the Maximum/Mean foot pressure value, the more stable the pulling action. Sixth, in Phase 2, the foot pressure was concentrated with a wide distribution in the midfoot and rearfoot. Seventh, the triggering number of the forefoot region was small in the last pull phase. Eighth, the number of triggers in the toe area was significantly higher during Good Motion in Phase 4.\\nConclusion: Summarizing the factors of instability in Snatch, there was no significant difference in Phase 1 for each condition. In order to enhance the stability in Phase 2, the sensory control ability in the AP direction is required, and focusing the foot pressing motion with a wide distribution in the middle and rear parts increases the instability. In Phase 3, it was found that the more unstable, the more sensory control activity was performed in the ML direction, the stronger the forefoot pressing action should be performed for a stable Snatch. In Phase 4, It is important that the feet sensory control activity in ML directions and the control ability of the toes in order to have stable Lock out motion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
       "Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of clubhead velocity through regression analysis on the magnitude and time difference of the forward-backward, mediolateral, and vertical ground reaction peak forces generated by force plate during golf swing. Method: 16 subjects (age: 20.5±4.2 yrs, height: 176.0±5.4 cm, weight: 77.8±5.9 kg, handy: 2.4±1.7) who is elite golf player in high school and university, participated in this study. The study method adopted three-dimensional analysis with 8 cameras and ground reaction force measurement with two force plate. The analysis variables were clubhead velocity, and ground reaction analysis variables set four events in each graph based on the peak forces commonly generated in Fx, Fy, and Fz graphs of the ground reaction data during the golf swing. Results: As a result of analyzing the influence of ground reaction magnitude difference on clubhead velocity, the influence on clubhead velocity was ym4, zm1, xm4, zm2. The larger ym4, xm4, zm1, the fasterthe clubhead velocity, but the smallerthe zm2, the faster the clubhead velocity. And in time difference, the influence on the clubhead velocity was in the order of xt4, zt1, zt3. The shorter xt4, zt1, zt3 showed faster clubhead velocity. Conclusion: The leftfoot played a leading role in increasing the velocity of the clubhead. Although the result was caused by the interaction of the right foot and the left foot during the swing, the role of the left foot is relatively large.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "이 연구의 목적은 각 분절의 마커세트와 무릎관절 중심 정의가 3차원 무릎 관절각을 산출하는데 얼마나 민감하게 영향을 미치는지를 연구하였다. 자료수집은 1명을 실험대상자로 하여 두 가지 형태의 각기 다른 분절의 정의와 무릎관절의 중심을 나타내는 반사마커들을 동시에 오른쪽 하지에 부착시켜 실험을 실시하였다. 실험대상자의 달리기동작 중 좌측으로 45도 방향전환동작의 지지기를 분석하였다. 이를 위해서 8대의 고속카메라들을 이용하였고 달리기속도는 4m/$sec{\\pm}(10%)$로 통제하였다. 하지분절의 발분절에는 하나의 마커세트를, 정강이와 대퇴분절에는 두 가지의 다른 마커세트들을 부착시켰다. 발분절에는 3개의 마커를 신발의 뒷부분에 부착하였고 정강이분절을 정의하기 위하여 첫 번째 마커세트는 경골을 중심으로 3개의 마커들을 두 번째 마커세트는 비골을 중심으로 3개의 마커를 부착하였다. 대퇴분절의 마커세트를 정의하기 위하여 첫 번째 마커세트에는 대퇴골을 중심으로 3개의 마커를 두 번째 마커세트에는 대퇴근육을 중심으로 3개의 마커들을 부착하였다. 무릎관절중심을 정의하는데 두 가지 다른 정의가 적용되었다. 첫 번째 무릎중심을 무릎의 내측과 외측의 마커들을 통해 두 마커의 중심을 무릎관절의 중심으로 정의하였다. 두 번째 무릎중심정의는 무릎의 외측부분과 슬개골의 중심에 부착된 마커들로부터의 교차점을 무릎관절중심으로 산출하였다. 무릎관절의 각도를 산출하기 위해서 JCS(Joint Coordinate System)의 정의가 적용되었고 연구의 결과는 다음과 같았다. 두 가지의 다른 분절마커세트 사이에서 무릎의 신전(extension)과 굴곡(flexion)은 유사한 형태를 나타냈으며 최대 무릎굴곡(peak knee flexion)각에서 $4.746^{\\circ}$의 차이를 나타냈다. 다른 분절마커세트 사이의 회전(rotation)각과 내전(adduction)/외전(abduction)에서는 서로 다른 형태를 나타내었고, 두 마커세트간 최대무릎외측회전(peak knee external rotation)각도에서는 $15.628^{\\circ}$의 차이를 나타냈다. 또한, 각 분절마커세트 내에서 두 가지의 다른 무릎관절 중심의 정의가 얼마나 무릎도 산출에 영향을 미치는지를 비교했을 때 무릎의 최대외측회전(peak external rotation)각에서 차이를 나타내었다. 첫 번째 분절마커세트의 무릎관절중심정의의 형태변화에 따라 최대외측회전각은 $0.549^{\\circ}$의 차이를 나타냈고, 두 번째 분절마커 세트에서 무릎관절중심정의의 형태변화에 따라 최대외측회전각은 $0.309^{\\circ}$의 차이를 나타냈다. 이와 같이 분절을 나타내는 마커세트와 무릎관절중심정의의 형태변화에 따라 무릎간을 계산하는데 있어서 결과가 다르게 산출되었다. 즉, 관절각의 계산이 분절에 부착되는 마커의 정의 혹은 위치에 매우 민감하게 영향을 받았다. 따라서 연구자가 여러 실험대상자들을 대상으로 실험시 마커세트 혹은 마커들을 동일한 위치에 가깝게 부착하는 것이 마커부착으로부터 발생하는 실험오차를 줄일 수 있을 것이다.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
